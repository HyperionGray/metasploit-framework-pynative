# Migration Tools Directory

This directory contains Python scripts and tools for the Ruby to Python migration initiative.

## Contents

- Migration scripts for converting Ruby code to Python
- Analysis tools for examining the codebase
- Verification utilities for ensuring migration integrity

## Usage

These tools are designed to be run manually and should not interfere with the normal operation of the Metasploit Framework.

## Note

The main Ruby framework remains functional and is the primary codebase. These migration tools are for future transition planning.

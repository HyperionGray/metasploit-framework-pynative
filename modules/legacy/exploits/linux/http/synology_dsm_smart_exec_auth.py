"""
Synology DiskStation Manager smart.cgi Remote Command Execution

This module exploits a vulnerability found in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM)
versions < 5.2-5967-5, which allows the execution of arbitrary commands under root
privileges after website authentication.
The vulnerability is located in webman/modules/StorageManager/smart.cgi, which
allows appending of a command to the device to be scanned.  However, the command
with drive is limited to 30 characters.  A somewhat valid drive name is required,
thus /dev/sd is used, even though it doesn't exist.  To circumvent the character
restriction, a wget input file is staged in /a, and executed to download our payload
to /b.  From there the payload is executed.  A wfsdelay is required to give time
for the payload to download, and the execution of it to run.

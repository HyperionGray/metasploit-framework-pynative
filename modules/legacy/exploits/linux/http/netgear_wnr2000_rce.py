"""
NETGEAR WNR2000v5 (Un)authenticated hidden_lang_avi Stack Buffer Overflow

The NETGEAR WNR2000 router has a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the hidden_lang_avi
parameter.
In order to exploit it, it is necessary to guess the value of a certain timestamp which
is in the configuration of the router. An authenticated attacker can simply fetch this
from a page, but an unauthenticated attacker has to brute force it.
Brute forcing the timestamp token might take a few minutes, a few hours, or days, but
it is guaranteed that it can be bruteforced.
This module implements both modes, and it works very reliably. It has been tested with
the WNR2000v5, firmware versions 1.0.0.34 and 1.0.0.18. It should also work with hardware
revisions v4 and v3, but this has not been tested - with these routers it might be necessary
to adjust the LibcBase variable as well as the gadget addresses.

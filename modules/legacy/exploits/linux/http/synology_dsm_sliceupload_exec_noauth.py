"""
This module exploits a vulnerability found in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM)
versions 4.x, which allows the execution of arbitrary commands under root
privileges.
The vulnerability is located in /webman/imageSelector.cgi, which allows to append
arbitrary data to a given file using a so called SLICEUPLOAD functionality, which
can be triggered by an unauthenticated user with a specially crafted HTTP request.
This is exploited by this module to append the given commands to /redirect.cgi,
which is a regular shell script file, and can be invoked with another HTTP request.
Synology reported that the vulnerability has been fixed with versions 4.0-2259,
4.2-3243, and 4.3-3810 Update 1, respectively; the 4.1 branch remains vulnerable.

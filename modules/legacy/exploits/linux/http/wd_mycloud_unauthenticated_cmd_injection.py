"""
Western Digital MyCloud unauthenticated command injection

This module exploits authentication bypass (CVE-2018-17153) and
command injection (CVE-2016-10108) vulnerabilities in Western
Digital MyCloud before 2.30.196 in order to achieve
unauthenticated remote code execution as the root user.

The module first performs a check to see if the target is
WD MyCloud. If so, it attempts to trigger an authentication
bypass (CVE-2018-17153) via a crafted GET request to
/cgi-bin/network_mgr.cgi. If the server responds as expected,
the module assesses the vulnerability status by attempting to
exploit a commend injection vulnerability (CVE-2016-10108) in
order to print a random string via the echo command. This is
done via a crafted POST request to /web/google_analytics.php.

If the server is vulnerable, the same command injection vector
is leveraged to execute the payload.

This module has been successfully tested against Western Digital
MyCloud version 2.30.183.

Note: based on the available disclosures, it seems that the
command injection vector (CVE-2016-10108) might be exploitable
without the authentication bypass (CVE-2018-17153) on versions
before 2.21.126. The obtained results on 2.30.183 imply that
the patch for CVE-2016-10108 did not actually remove the command
injection vector, but only prevented unauthenticated access to it.

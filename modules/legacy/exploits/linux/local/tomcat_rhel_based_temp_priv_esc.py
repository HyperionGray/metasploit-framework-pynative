"""
Apache Tomcat on RedHat Based Systems Insecure Temp Config Privilege Escalation

This module exploits a vulnerability in RedHat based systems where
improper file permissions are applied to /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf
for Apache Tomcat versions before 7.0.54-8.  This may also work against

The configuration files in tmpfiles.d are used by systemd-tmpfiles to manage
temporary files including their creation.

With this weak permission, we're able to inject commands into systemd-tmpfiles
service to write a cron job to execute our payload.

systemd-tmpfiles is executed by default on boot on RedHat-based systems
through systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service. Depending on the system in use,
the execution of systemd-tmpfiles could also be triggered by other
services, cronjobs, startup scripts etc.

This module was tested against Tomcat 7.0.54-3 on Fedora 21.

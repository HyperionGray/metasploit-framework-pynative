Android Stagefright MP4 tx3g Integer Overflow

This module exploits an integer overflow vulnerability in the Stagefright
Library (libstagefright.so). The vulnerability occurs when parsing specially
crafted MP4 files. While a wide variety of remote attack vectors exist, this
particular exploit is designed to work within an HTML5 compliant browser.

Exploitation is done by supplying a specially crafted MP4 file with two
tx3g atoms that, when their sizes are summed, cause an integer overflow when
processing the second atom. As a result, a temporary buffer is allocated
with insufficient size and a memcpy call leads to a heap overflow.

This version of the exploit uses a two-stage information leak based on
corrupting the MetaData that the browser reads from mediaserver. This method
is based on a technique published in NorthBit's Metaphor paper. First,
we use a variant of their technique to read the address of a heap buffer
located adjacent to a SampleIterator object as the video HTML element's
videoHeight. Next, we read the vtable pointer from an empty Vector within
the SampleIterator object using the video element's duration. This gives
us a code address that we can use to determine the base address of
libstagefright and construct a ROP chain dynamically.

NOTE: the mediaserver process on many Android devices (Nexus, for example) is
constrained by SELinux and thus cannot use the execve system call. To avoid
this problem, the original exploit uses a kernel exploit payload that disables
SELinux and spawns a shell as root. Work is underway to make the framework
more amenable to these types of situations. Until that work is complete, this
exploit will only yield a shell on devices without SELinux or with SELinux in
permissive mode.

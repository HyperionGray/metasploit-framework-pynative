VisiWave VWR File Parsing Vulnerability

This module exploits a vulnerability found in VisiWave's Site Survey Report application.
When processing .VWR files, VisiWaveReport.exe attempts to match a valid pointer based on the 'Type'
property (valid ones include 'Properties', 'TitlePage', 'Details', 'Graph', 'Table', 'Text',
'Image'), but if a match isn't found, the function that's supposed to handle this routine
ends up returning the input as a pointer, and later used in a CALL DWORD PTR [EDX+10]
instruction.  This allows attackers to overwrite it with any arbitrary value, and results code
execution.  A patch is available at visiwave.com; the fix is done by XORing the return value as
null if no match is found, and then it is validated before use.

NOTE: During installation, the application will register two file handles, VWS and VWR, which allows a
victim user to 'double click' the malicious VWR file and execute code.  This module was also built
to bypass ASLR and DEP.

"""
Group Policy Script Execution From Shared Resource

This is a general-purpose module for exploiting systems with Windows Group Policy
configured to load VBS startup/logon scripts from remote locations. This module runs
a SMB shared resource that will provide a payload through a VBS file. Startup scripts
will be executed with SYSTEM privileges, while logon scripts will be executed with the
user privileges. Have into account which the attacker still needs to redirect the
target traffic to the fake SMB share to exploit it successfully. Please note in some
cases, it will take 5 to 10 minutes to receive a session.

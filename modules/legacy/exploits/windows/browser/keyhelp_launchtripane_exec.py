"""
KeyHelp ActiveX LaunchTriPane Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

This module exploits a code execution vulnerability in the KeyScript ActiveX
control from keyhelp.ocx. It is packaged in several products or GE, such as
Proficy Historian 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, and 3.1, Proficy HMI/SCADA 5.1 and 5.0, Proficy
Pulse 1.0, Proficy Batch Execution 5.6, and SI7 I/O Driver between 7.20 and 7.42.
When the control is installed with these products, the function "LaunchTriPane"
will use ShellExecute to launch "hh.exe", with user controlled data as parameters.
Because of this, the "-decompile" option can be abused to write arbitrary files on
the remote system.

Code execution can be achieved by first uploading the payload to the remote
machine, and then upload another mof file, which enables Windows Management
Instrumentation service to execute it. Please note that this module currently only
works for Windows before Vista.

On the other hand, the target host must have the WebClient service (WebDAV
Mini-Redirector) enabled. It is enabled and automatically started by default on
Windows XP SP3

"""
HP OpenView NNM 7.53, 7.51 OVAS.EXE Pre-Authentication Stack Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager versions 7.53 and earlier.
Specifically this vulnerability is caused by a failure to properly handle user supplied input within the
HTTP request including headers and the actual URL GET request.

Exploitation is tricky due to character restrictions. It was necessary to utilize a egghunter shellcode
which was alphanumeric encoded by muts in the original exploit.

If you plan on using exploit this for a remote shell, you will likely want to migrate to a different process
as soon as possible. Any connections get reset after a short period of time. This is probably some timeout
handling code that causes this.

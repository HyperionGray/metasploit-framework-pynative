MDaemon WorldClient form2raw.cgi Stack Buffer Overflow

This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Alt-N MDaemon SMTP server for
versions 6.8.5 and earlier. When WorldClient HTTP server is installed (default),
a CGI script is provided to accept html FORM based emails and deliver via MDaemon.exe,
by writing the CGI output to the Raw Queue. When X-FromCheck is enabled (also default),
the temporary form2raw.cgi data is copied by MDaemon.exe and a stack based
overflow occurs when an excessively long From field is specified.
The RawQueue is processed every 1 minute by default, to a maximum of 60 minutes.
Keep this in mind when choosing payloads or setting WfsDelay... You'll need to wait.

Furthermore, this exploit uses a direct memory jump into a nopsled (which isn't very
reliable). Once the payload is written into the Raw Queue by Form2Raw, MDaemon will
continue to crash/execute the payload until the CGI output is manually deleted
from the queue in C:\MDaemon\RawFiles\*.raw.

"""
VICIdial Manager Send OS Command Injection

The file agc/manager_send.php in the VICIdial web application uses
unsanitized user input as part of a command that is executed using the PHP
passthru() function. A valid username, password and session are needed to access
the injection point. Fortunately, VICIdial has two built-in accounts with default
passwords and the manager_send.php file has a SQL injection vulnerability that can
be used to bypass the session check as long as at least one session has been
created at some point in time. In case there isn't any valid session, the user can
provide astGUIcient credentials in order to create one. The results of the injected
commands are returned as part of the response from the web server. Affected versions
include 2.7RC1, 2.7, and 2.8-403a. Other versions are likely affected as well. The
default credentials used by Vicidial are VDCL/donotedit and VDAD/donotedit.

"""
WordPress WP EasyCart Unrestricted File Upload

WordPress Shopping Cart (WP EasyCart) Plugin for
WordPress contains a flaw that allows a remote
attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code. This
flaw exists because the
/inc/amfphp/administration/banneruploaderscript.php
script does not properly verify or sanitize
user-uploaded files. By uploading a .php file,
the remote system will place the file in a
user-accessible path. Making a direct request to
the uploaded file will allow the attacker to
execute the script with the privileges of the web
server.

In versions <= 3.0.8 authentication can be done by
using the WordPress credentials of a user with any
role. In later versions, a valid EasyCart admin
password will be required that is in use by any
admin user. A default installation of EasyCart will
setup a user called "demouser" with a preset password
of "demouser".

"""
Agent Tesla Panel Remote Code Execution

This module exploits a command injection vulnerability within the Agent Tesla control panel,
in combination with an SQL injection vulnerability and a PHP object injection vulnerability, to gain
remote code execution on affected hosts.

Panel versions released prior to Sepetember 12, 2018 can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers to
gain remote code execution as user running the web server. Agent Tesla panels released on or after
this date can still be exploited however, provided that attackers have valid credentials for the
Agent Tesla control panel.

Note that this module presently only fully supports Windows hosts running Agent Tesla on the WAMP stack.
Support for Linux may be added in a future update, but could not be confirmed during testing.

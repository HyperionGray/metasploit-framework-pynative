## Binary Analysis with Radare2

This fork includes advanced binary analysis capabilities with Radare2 integration:

- **GDB-like Commands**: Intuitive interface to Radare2 using familiar GDB syntax
- **LLDB Integration**: Dynamic debugging support for runtime analysis
- **Binary Instrumentation**: AFL-style coverage tracking and code path analysis  
- **In-Memory Fuzzing**: High-speed fuzzing with stack manipulation

See [RADARE2_QUICKSTART.md](RADARE2_QUICKSTART.md) for installation and usage guide.

Quick start:
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip3 install r2pipe

# Launch interactive debugger
python3 tools/binary_analysis/r2gdb.py /path/to/binary
```

## Installing Metasploit

### Recommended Installation

We recommend installation with the [official Metasploit installers](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/getting-started/nightly-installers.html#installing-metasploit-on-linux--macos) on Linux or macOS. Metasploit is also pre-installed with Kali.

For a manual setup, consult the [Dev Environment Setup](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/development/get-started/setting-up-a-metasploit-development-environment.html) guide.

## Using Metasploit

To get started with Metasploit:

1. **Start `msfconsole`:** This is the primary interface for interacting with Metasploit.
2. **Explore Resources:** 
   - Visit the [Using Metasploit](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/getting-started/index.html) section of the documentation.

## PF Framework Integration

This fork embraces modern exploitation tools and techniques. Write exploits as Python tasks with full access to:

- **Pwntools**: Industry-standard exploitation library
- **Radare2**: Advanced binary analysis and reversing
- **GDB/GEF/pwndbg**: Interactive debugging with automation
- **AFL++/libFuzzer**: Coverage-guided fuzzing with sanitizers
- **Ghidra**: NSA's reverse engineering platform

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# See example PF task
python3 examples/pf_task_example.py --help

# Set target via environment variables (simpler than MSF's 'set' commands)
export TARGET_HOST=192.168.1.100
export TARGET_PORT=9999
python3 examples/pf_task_example.py --mode exploit
```

**Documentation:**
- [PF Integration Guide](documentation/PF_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) - Write exploits as PF tasks
- [Exploit Writing Guide](documentation/EXPLOIT_WRITING_GUIDE.md) - Comprehensive exploitation tutorial
- [Module Categorization](documentation/MODULE_CATEGORIZATION.md) - Understanding legacy vs. active modules

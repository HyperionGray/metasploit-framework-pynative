# ============================================================================
# CATEGORY: Redundant Enumeration Tools
# These duplicate functionality of standard tools like nmap, masscan, etc.
# Use the standard tools directly - they're better maintained and more reliable.
# ============================================================================

# Note: Many scanner modules will be added here after analysis
# The ones that provide unique value (like exploit-specific scanners) remain active

# Examples to be evaluated:
# - auxiliary/scanner/portscan/* (use nmap instead)
# - auxiliary/scanner/discovery/* (use nmap/masscan instead)
# - Many auxiliary/scanner/http/* modules duplicate dirb/gobuster/ffuf

# ============================================================================
# CATEGORY: Ancient Exploits (Pre-2010)
# These target systems that are largely obsolete.
# Maintained for historical reference only.
# ============================================================================

# Note: This section will be populated with exploits from before 2010 after
# comprehensive analysis. Age alone isn't sufficient - we need to consider
# if the target systems are still in use.

# Examples:
# - Most Windows XP exploits (except in special cases)
# - Ancient Unix vulnerabilities (unless target is still common)
# - Legacy application exploits for software no longer maintained

# ============================================================================
# CATEGORY: Proof-of-Concept Only (Old and Unreliable)
# These are PoCs that don't work reliably and haven't been updated recently.
# ============================================================================

# Note: This requires manual review of modules marked with low reliability
# scores and old disclosure dates.

# ============================================================================
# CATEGORY: Poor Tool Integrations
# These are half-baked wrappers around tools where direct usage is better.
# ============================================================================

# Note: This requires analysis of modules that wrap external tools poorly.

# ============================================================================
# NOTES ON CATEGORIZATION
# ============================================================================
#
# This is a living document. Modules are added as they are identified.
# 
# Criteria for marking as legacy:
# 1. Better alternatives exist and are readily available
# 2. Module represents outdated techniques or targets
# 3. Module is unreliable or poorly maintained
# 4. Module provides no unique value
#
# Modules NOT marked as legacy:
# 1. Well-maintained modules with unique functionality
# 2. Modules for currently relevant targets (even if old)
# 3. Modules that integrate well with modern tooling
# 4. Educational modules that teach valuable concepts
#
# Process for adding modules:
# 1. Identify candidate based on criteria
# 2. Verify better alternative exists
# 3. Document reason and alternative
# 4. Add to this file
# 5. Optionally mark in module itself with Msf::Module::Deprecated

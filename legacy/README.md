# Legacy Ruby Codebase

This directory contains the original Ruby codebase from the Metasploit Framework that was created or last significantly modified before 2021.

## Structure

The directory structure mirrors the original Metasploit Framework layout:

- `modules/` - Legacy exploit, auxiliary, post, and other modules
- `lib/` - Legacy framework core libraries
- `tools/` - Legacy development and analysis tools
- `scripts/` - Legacy operational scripts
- `external/` - Legacy external source code

## Purpose

This legacy codebase is preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Compatibility during transition period
- Research and analysis of older exploits
- Maintaining support for legacy systems

## Migration Status

All post-2020 content has been migrated to Python in the main framework directories.
The current framework is Python-native for all new development.

## Usage

Legacy modules can still be referenced but are not actively maintained.
For new development, use the Python framework in the main directories.

# Legacy Ruby Code Archive

This directory contains legacy Ruby code that has been moved here as part of the Ruby to Python migration initiative.

## Purpose

All Ruby files from the active codebase have been moved here to preserve the legacy code while transitioning to a Python-first approach.

## Directory Structure

- `modules/`    - Legacy Ruby modules (exploits, auxiliary, etc.)
- `lib/`        - Legacy Ruby framework libraries  
- `tools/`      - Legacy Ruby development tools
- `scripts/`    - Legacy Ruby operational scripts
- `plugins/`    - Legacy Ruby plugins
- `external/`   - Legacy external Ruby dependencies

## Migration Status

✅ **Ruby Elimination Complete**  
🐍 **Python is now the primary language**  
📦 **Legacy Ruby code preserved here**

This preserves the historical Ruby codebase while allowing the project to move forward with Python as the primary language.

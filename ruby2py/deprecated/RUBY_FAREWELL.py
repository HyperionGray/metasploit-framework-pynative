📜 OFFICIAL RUBY OBITUARY 📜

Here lies Ruby
Born: 1995
Died: Today (converted to Python)
Cause of death: Python fever cure

"Ruby was okay, but Python is cooler" - The Cool Kids

Ruby served the Metasploit Framework well, but it's time to move on.
The cool kids demanded Python, and the fever could only be cured
with MORE PYTHON!

Ruby's last words: "At least... I'm being converted to... Python... 
the coolest language... tell my modules... they're in good hands..."

🐍 Python has taken over! 🐍

Services will be held at /dev/null
In lieu of flowers, please contribute more Python code.

Rest in Peace, Ruby
Long Live Python! 🐍

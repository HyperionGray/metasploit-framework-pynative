# Backup Directory

This directory contains deprecated scripts, test files, and miscellaneous files that were moved from the root directory during repository cleanup.

## Contents

- **Shell scripts** (*.sh) - Old bash scripts, mostly for conversion workflows
- **Test files** - Standalone test files that were in root
- **Conversion utilities** - Miscellaneous conversion helper scripts
- **Old configuration files** - Deprecated config and setup files

## Purpose

These files are kept for reference and historical purposes. They are not part of the active codebase and should not be used for new work.

## Using Files from This Directory

If you need to reference or use any of these files:

1. Check if there's a modern equivalent in the active codebase
2. Review the file to understand its purpose
3. Consider if it should be updated and moved back to an appropriate location
4. If it's truly needed, create a proper implementation instead of using the backup version

## Cleanup

This directory can be reviewed periodically and files that are no longer needed can be safely deleted.
